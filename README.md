ng-notify ([live demo](http://matowens.github.io/ng-notify/#demo)) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matowens/ng-notify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matowens/ng-notify) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/matowens/ng-notify/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/matowens/ng-notify)
=========

A simple, lightweight module for displaying notifications in your AngularJS app.

[![ngNotify Demo](assets/screenshot.jpg)](http://matowens.github.io/ng-notify)

Both JS and CSS files combine for ~5.5 kBs.

IE9+ (AngularJS v1.3.x no longer supports IE8) and the latest versions of Chrome, FireFox and Safari have been tested and are supported.  If you do run across any issues, please submit a [new issue](https://github.com/matowens/ng-notify/issues) and I'll take a look - or better yet - submit a PR with the bug fix and I'll merge it in.

You can check out the vitals and demo here: [http://matowens.github.io/ng-notify](http://matowens.github.io/ng-notify)

#### Newest Additions

With v0.8.0 comes a couple new features.  The first, being able to target a specific container for your notification to display in - for a more modular style display.  To do so, simply specify a `target` option with the value set to a CSS selector string when you set a message or setup the initial configuration. [More on that below](#modular-notifications).  In addition, you are now able to provide a callback that will fire after fadeout and the notification has been removed from view.  This callback can be added as an optional third parameter when calling the set() method.  [More on that here](#notification-callbacks).  With these changes comes a refactor that uses notification instances which will assist with future development as we look to introduce new features like stacked notifications and upgrade for use with Angular 2.

Implementation
==============

### Requirements

AngularJS is the only dependency.  Animation is achieved with pure JS, jQuery not necessary.

### Installation

You can install ng-notify with Bower.

    bower install ng-notify --save

You can also install ng-notify with npm.

    npm install ng-notify --save

As of v0.6.0, ng-notify is now available via the jsDelivr CDN if you'd prefer to go down that route.

    //cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ng-notify@{version.number.here}/dist/ng-notify.min.js
    //cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ng-notify@{version.number.here}/dist/ng-notify.min.css

For example:

    //cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ng-notify@0.7.1/dist/ng-notify.min.js
    //cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ng-notify@0.7.1/dist/ng-notify.min.css

And as always, you can download the source files straight from this repo - they're located in the `dist` dir.  Be sure to include the minified version of both js and css files.

### Usage

After including *ng-notify.min.js* and *ng-notify.min.css*, inject the ng-notify provider into your project.

```javascript
var app = angular.module('demo', ['ngNotify']);
```

Now you can trigger notifications from anywhere in your app.  To display a notification, just use the `set` method.

```javascript
ngNotify.set('Your notification message goes here!');
```

To specify the *type* of notification to display, provide the optional *type* param. (For available types, check the [definitions](#definitions) below.)

```javascript
ngNotify.set('Your error message goes here!', 'error');
```

Advanced Usage
==============

### Default Configuration

You can override the default options for all notifications by using the `config` method.  None of these options are required. (For available options, check the [definitions](#definitions) below.)

```javascript
ngNotify.config({
    theme: 'pure',
    position: 'bottom',
    duration: 3000,
    type: 'info',
    sticky: false,
    button: true,
    html: false
});
```

Default configuration options can be set during the `run()` block.  If your app utilizes a global controller, the config options could be set there just as well.  For a discussion and working example on this topic, checkout [this comment](https://github.com/matowens/ng-notify/issues/16#issuecomment-104492193).

### Individual Configurations

You can also pass an object of options to individual notifications.  You can pass through any combination of our available options here as well.  (For available options, check the [definitions](#definitions) below.)  For example:

```javascript
ngNotify.set('Your first message.', {
    position: 'top',
    sticky: true
});

ngNotify.set('Your second message.', {
    type: 'error',
    duration: 2000
});

ngNotify.set('Your third message.', 'error'); // Original use case still works, too.

ngNotify.set('Your <i>fourth</i> message.', {
    theme: 'pitchy',
    html: true
});
```

### Sticky Notifications

Sticky notifications allow you to set a persistent notification that doesn't fade away.  To do this, simply set the `sticky` attribute to true:

```javascript
ngNotify.set('This is sticky.', {
    sticky: true
});
```

This will give the user the option of closing the notification themselves.  If you need to dismiss a notification manually, you can do so with the `dismiss` method like this:

```javascript
ngNotify.dismiss();
```

If you'd prefer to dismiss the notification programmatically and prevent the user from doing so, you can add an option to remove the button:

```javascript
ngNotify.set('This is sticky without a button.', {
    sticky: true,
    button: false
});
```

*Any time a notification is set to sticky, the duration attribute will be ignored since the notification will not be automatically fading out.*

### HTML Notifications

HTML notifications will allow you to display messages with HTML content in them.  To do this, you'll need to set the `html` attribute to true:

```javascript
ngNotify.set('This has <b>HTML</b> content!', {
    html: true
});
```

You can also set HTML notifications to be enabled for all of your notifications by adding it the ngNotify config like so:

```javascript
ngNotify.config({
    html: true
});
```
In order for HTML notifications to display, you are required to include the [ngSanitize](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngSanitize) script in your app (eg, via Google CDN, Bower, or code.angular.org).  There's no need to add it as a dependency to ngNotify.  If ngNotify has found the ngSanitize script, it will add it as a dependency to the ngNotify module dynamically.  Once included, you just need to toggle the `html` attribute to true and the module will handle the rest.

If you don't have ngSanitize included and you do set `html` to true, ngNotify will gracefully degrade back to the default message display and print a debug message to remind you in your browser's console.

### Modular Notifications

By specifying a `target` option, you are able to control where your notifications are displayed.  By default, the target is set to the body tag but you may provide any other CSS selector in order to control where the notification is appended.  For example:

```javascript
ngNotify.set('This message has a specific container!', {
    target: '#new-container'
});
```

You may also specific a default target for all notifications by adding it to the ngNotify config, for example:

```javascript
ngNotify.config({
    target: '#new-container'
});
```

** Notifications that have a custom target specified are set to display with absolute positioning, overriding the default fixed positioning.  It's impossible to tailor ngNotify's style to fit every situation for every app, so you may have to tweak the styles to fit your specific needs when not appending notifications to the body tag - using anything other than the default target.

### Notification Callbacks

You have an option to call a function when a notification has completed.  This callback can only be called through the set() method and is passed as an optional third parameter.  For example:

```javascript
var callback = function() {};

ngNotify.set('This message has a callback.', {}, callback);
```

The callback will fire every time it is specified, even if the notification is dismissed early through the dismiss method.  The callback fires once the notification has faded out.

### Roll Your Own

There are two additional methods that allow you to create your own types and themes.

##### Custom Notification Types

Creating a custom type will allow you to add additional types of notifications to use throughout your application.  To create a new type, use the `addType` method.  The first param is the *name* you'll use to reference your new type.  The second param is the *class* you'll use to style your new notification type.

```javascript
ngNotify.addType('notice', 'my-notice-type');
```

Then you can set any of your notifications up to use that type as you would any other, triggering it by using the name you gave it.

```javascript
ngNotify.set('This notification is using our new type!', 'notice');
```

To style your new type, pick a color you'd like to use and set it to the background color of your new style.

```sass
.my-notice-type
    background-color: #ABC123
```

##### Custom Themes

Creating a custom theme will allow you to build an entirely new spectrum of notification messages utilizing the existing notification types.  To create a new theme, use the `addTheme` method.  The first param is the *name* you'll use to reference your new theme.  The second param is the *class* you'll use to style your new theme's notification types.

```javascript
ngNotify.addTheme('newTheme', 'my-new-theme');
```

Now you can activate your new theme via the config method, using the name you previously assigned to it.

```javascript
ngNotify.config({
    theme: 'newTheme'
});
```

To style your new theme, pick a collection of colors you'd like to use for each notification type and set them to each type's background color.

```sass
.my-new-theme.ngn-info
    background-color: #0033CC

.my-new-theme.ngn-error
    background-color: #FF0000

.my-new-theme.ngn-success
    background-color: #00CC00

.my-new-theme.ngn-warn
    background-color: #FF9900

.my-new-theme.ngn-grimace
    background-color: #660099
```

##### Custom Styles

The position, size, color, alignment and more are all styled based on the notification's classes and are all specified in the CSS file. See the [style definitions](#styles) below to see which classes can be used to override any of the styles within your own application.

Definitions
===========

### Methods

#### set(message, type|config, callback)
displays a notification message and sets the formatting/behavioral options for this one notification.
- **message**: *string* - *required* - the message to display in your notification.

Development
===========

If you've forked or cloned the project and would like to make any sort of adjustments, there are few items to make note of.  First, your system will need to have the following bits in place:

- Node & NPM
- Grunt
- Ruby
- Sass

Second, there are a few grunt tasks that you'll be able to leverage to help validate and prepare your changes for use.

You can fire off a `grunt` or `grunt build` command manually at any time to lint, minify, and setup your demo (built in the _gh-pages dir) for testing.

```console
grunt (or grunt build)
```

Also, you can run `grunt dev` to lint, minify, and prep your demo for testing.  Once the build is complete, it'll also fire off a `watch` so that any changes that are made to the the sass, js, and demo files will automatically trigger the build script to update your project.

```console
grunt dev
```

To run through the configured unit tests, you can run `grunt test`.  This will fire off a series of tests that check that all default options are set correctly, all configurable options are able to be set correctly, and that all methods carry out the functionality that they're supposed to.  These tests should let you know if any of the updates that you've made have negatively effected any preexisting functionality.  Also, when the tests complete, there will be a test coverage report generated and stored in the `coverage` directory.

```console
grunt test
```

Next, you'll want to do all of your development within three locations.  If you add changes anywhere else, they're likely to be overwritten during the build process.  These locations are:

`src/scripts/ng-notify.js` - for any script modifications.

`src/styles/ng-notify.sass` - for any style modifications.

`demo/*` - for any modifications to the demo.

Lastly, once you've made your changes and run through the appropriate grunt tasks, your changes should be baked and ready for you to consume - located in the `dist` directory as minified js and css files.
